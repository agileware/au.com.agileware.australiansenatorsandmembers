  <name>Import Australian Senators and Members</name>
  <description>This CiviCRM extension provides an API action (SenatorsAndMembers update) that fetches 'All Senators by Party' and 'All Members by Party' CSVs (currently available at http://www.aph.gov.au/Senators_and_Members/Guidelines_for_Contacting_Senators_and_Members/Address_labels_and_CSV_files) and imports them into CiviCRM, assigning each senator or member to a party-specific group. The Electorate office address and phone number are also imported. The source data currently contains no email addresses which is why there is no attempt to import these.</description>
